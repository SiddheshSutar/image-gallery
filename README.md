This 'image-gallery' project, 'my-pod' is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Since React.js docs have been migrated to Next.js now, hence I have given a try to implement using Next.js

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

# Imp !!!!
The browser events are not working properly in recen versions of Chrome and Edge; please use Firefox (  as I have used the same ) 

# Thought process
I tried to create minimal design of CRUD operations on how an image gallery would work.

# IMP: I also tried to integrate the 'upload' process via firebase storage, but got stuck at a point 
# where the url returned by firebase downloadUrl method is not a simple GET request image url.
# Working on that in another [https://github.com/SiddheshSutar/image-gallery/tree/firebasePOC] branch, meanwhile I just made CRUD on a simple text field.


Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
